Scientists Discover Ancient Microbial Life Thriving Deep Beneath Antarctic Ice.
Researchers have announced the discovery of a diverse community of microorganisms living in a subglacial lake nearly 1,000 meters beneath the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. The findings, published in Nature, suggest that these organisms have been isolated from sunlight and the atmosphere for potentially millions of years. Scientists drilled through the ice to access Mercer Subglacial Lake and collected water and sediment samples. Analysis revealed a complex ecosystem, including bacteria and archaea, demonstrating the resilience of life in extreme environments. This discovery expands the understanding of habitable zones on Earth and potentially other planets.

New Study Links Gut Microbiome Shifts to Increased Risk of Alzheimer's Disease •
Researchers at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus have identified a significant correlation between alterations in the gut microbiome and an elevated risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. The study, published in Alzheimer’s Research & Therapy, examined stool samples from over 150 individuals with and without the disease. Participants with Alzheimer’s exhibited a notable decrease in beneficial bacteria, particularly those associated with short-chain fatty acid production. This suggests a potential pathway by which imbalances in gut bacteria could contribute to the progression of the neurodegenerative disorder.
