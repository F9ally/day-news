    "summary": "Title: Active ETFs See Surge in Investments Amid Market Volatility\n\n1. Active ETF inflows account for 30% of U.S. ETF investments in 2025, with 34% of new allocations going to actively managed ETFs.\n2. New launches and conversions of mutual funds into ETFs are revitalizing the active fund industry, offering lower fees and greater liquidity compared to traditional active funds.\n3. Market volatility has created opportunities for active managers to outperform, leading to increased interest in actively managed ETFs.\n4. Concerns about concentration risk in indexes, particularly overvalued tech stocks, may be driving investors towards active funds for diversification.\n5. Younger, more aggressive retail investors are fueling the surge in inflows into active funds, seeking market-beating gains rather than steady returns.\n6. Despite the resurgence of active funds, numerous studies indicate that passive index funds deliver greater long-term returns compared to actively managed funds, especially when considering fees."
